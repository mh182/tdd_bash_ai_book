# Complying to Shell Style Guide

`data_download` doesn't comply to the used [Shell Style Guide]. Jane

- [function location](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html#s7.6-function-location):
  put all functions together below constants. A function called `main` as the
  bottom-most function, the last non-comment line in the file should be a call
  to `main`.
- [Constants, Environment Variables, and readonly
  Variables](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html#s7.3-constants-and-environment-variable-names):
  the constants we set at runtime are not made readonly.
- [STDOUT vs STDERR](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html#s3.1-stdout-vs-stderr):
  error messages are not going to `STDERR`.

> ### Changes made:
>
> - Moved global variables (`URL`, `DIRECTORY`) to the top, after the `set` command.
> - Created `parse_args` function to handle argument parsing.
> - Marked global variables `URL` and `DIRECTORY` as read-only after their values are set.
> - Created `main` function that calls `parse_args` and `download_data`.
> - The script execution starts by calling the `main` function at the end.

Jane replaced the current implementation with the generated code and runs
the test suite - all executed tests passed. Without those tests she would not
have been confident to replace the code.

All she had to address now is the separation of `STDOUT` and `STDERR`. Chapter
4 - Mind the streams - of [12 Factor CLI Apps] and [Command Line Interface Guideline]
are a good source how the output of a CLI should look like and how to deal with
errors.
