# Complying to Shell Style Guide

`data_download` doesn't comply to the used [Shell Style Guide]. Jane

- [function location](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html#s7.6-function-location):
  put all functions together below constants. A function called `main` as the
  bottom-most function, the last non-comment line in the file should be a call
  to `main`.
- [Constants, Environment Variables, and readonly
  Variables](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html#s7.3-constants-and-environment-variable-names):
  the constants we set at runtime are not made readonly.
- [STDOUT vs STDERR](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html#s3.1-stdout-vs-stderr):
  error messages are not going to `STDERR`.

> ### Changes made:
>
> - Moved global variables (`URL`, `DIRECTORY`) to the top, after the `set` command.
> - Created `parse_args` function to handle argument parsing.
> - Marked global variables `URL` and `DIRECTORY` as read-only after their values are set.
> - Created `main` function that calls `parse_args` and `download_data`.
> - The script execution starts by calling the `main` function at the end.

Jane replaced the current implementation with the generated code and runs
the test suite - all executed tests passed. Without those tests she would not
have been confident to replace the code.

All she had to address now is the separation of `STDOUT` and `STDERR`. Chapter
4 - Mind the streams - of [12 Factor CLI Apps] and [Command Line Interface Guideline]
are a good source how the output of a CLI should look like and how to deal with
errors.

Answer from ChatGPT:

> Here's the updated test case to reflect the new behavior, which writes a short error message followed by usage and a hint, all to STDERR:
>
> ```bash
> @test "Script prints error and usage when no arguments are provided" {
>     run data_download
>     assert_failure 1
>     assert_error --partial "Error: Missing arguments."
>     assert_error --partial "Usage:"
>     assert_error --partial "Hint: Call the script with --help for more information."
> }
> ```

> - **`assert_error`** is used to check the output on `STDERR` rather than `STDOUT`.
> - The test checks for a short error message, usage, and the hint about the `--help` option.

> This means the URL is not optional, the directory flag is optional. If the directory is not provided, the working directory from which the script is called is used as target directory.
> Note that the name of the script is printed in the usage, without directory name. Please change data_download so this test would pass.
